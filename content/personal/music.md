Here I will list some interesting things related to music that come to my mind: 

* [Pastorali Tarantine](/Pastorali_tarantine.mp3), traditional Christmas compositions which remind the music of the Sheperds that worship the baby Jesus.

* ["The song of the prophecies"](/Invitatorio.pdf), a Chatolic chant which collects the prophecies about the coming of the Saviour; it is executed during the nine days before Christmas.  Here I share an Italian translation of the original (in latin) and the PDF was realised by myself thanks to Gregoriotex, a package to write Gregorian chant in $\Latex$.
