Here I will list some interesting things related to music that come to my mind: 

* Traditional "pastorali" of Taranto: [Pastorali Tarantine](/Pastorali_tarantine.mp3)
* ["The song of the prophecies"](/Invitatorio.pdf), a Chatolic chant executed during the nine days before Christmas collecting all the prophecies about the coming of the Saviour. Here I share an Italian translation of the original (in latin) and the PDF was realised by myself thanks to Gregoriotex, a package to write Gregorian chant in latex.
