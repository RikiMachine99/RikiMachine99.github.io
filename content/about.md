# It's me: Riccardo Marinelli

## Past education 

I went to primary and secondary school in **Monteiasi (Ta)** until I chose my high school: **Liceo Scientifico Battaglini**, in **Taranto (TA)**; there I developed my interests in Maths, Physics and science in general.

In Monteiasi I also recieved Catholic education, I'm still a proud Catholic.

In 2017 I moved from Monteiasi to **Rome** where I became a Physics student at **"La Sapienza" University** and where I obtained the bachelor degree **cum laude**.

## Now

Currently I'm a master-degree student at the same university, I'm attending courses for **General Theoretical Physics**
