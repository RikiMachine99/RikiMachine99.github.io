# It's me: Riccardo Marinelli

## Past education 

I went to primary and secondary school in **Monteiasi (Ta)** until I chose my high school: **Liceo Scientifico Battaglini**, in **Taranto (TA)**; there I developed my interests in Maths, Physics and science in general.

In Monteiasi I also recieved catholic education, I'm still a proud catholic.

In 2017 I moved from Monteiasi to **Rome** where I became a Physics student at **"La Sapienza" University** and where I obtained the bachelor degree *cum laude*.

## Now

Currently I'm a master-degree student at the same university, I'm attending courses for **General Theoretical Physics**.

## Interests

* Regarding my Physics studies, I'm interested in Theroretical Phisics for **particles** [^1].
* As i said, I'm a proud catholic, i'm interested in all themes regarding hystory of the Church, lifes of saints, catholic art and christian liturgy.
* Since I was a child I loved Disney characters and I've read for 14 years the italian comic **Topolino** [^2].
