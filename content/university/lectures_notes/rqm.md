# Relativistic quantum mechanics

## Informations about the course

the course on Relativistic Quantum Mechanic was held by professor Roberto Bonciani[^1] at **Sapienza University**, the notes have been taken during the firt semester of academic year 2020/2021.

## Scheme of the notes

For now I will put the notes divided by week, in the future i will list notes based on arguments.


## List and arguments of the notes
