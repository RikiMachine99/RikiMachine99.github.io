# Quantum Field Theory

## Info about the course

* Language : English

* The course on quantum Electrodynamics was held by professor Alfredo Urbano at **Sapienza University**, the notes have been taken during the first semester of academic year 2021/2022.

## Characteristics of the notes

- I took the notes using _Notabilty_ on **Ipad pro**.
- The notes are hand taken, I hope I'll will be able to convert them in LaTeX one day.
- The notes are given in four parts, coherently with the structure of the lectures. The fourth part is raw, you can find some infos on EWI lectures or in the furure in the QCD lectures.
- These notes are easily editable, if you spot some errors please let me know e-mailing me or via social networks, my contacts are in home/about.
