# Relativistic quantum mechanics

## Info about the course

* Language : italian

* The course on Relativistic Quantum Mechanic was held by professor Roberto Bonciani[^1] at **Sapienza University**, the notes have been taken during the firt semester of academic year 2020/2021.

## Characteristics of the notes

- I took the notes using _Notabilty_ on **Ipad pro**.
- The notes are hand taken, I hope I'll will be able to convert then in LaTeX one day.
- For now I will put the notes divided by week, in the future i will list notes based on arguments.
- These notes are easily editable, if you spot some errors please let me know e-mailing me or via social networks, my contacts are in home/about.
