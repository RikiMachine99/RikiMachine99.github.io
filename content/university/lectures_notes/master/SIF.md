# Simmetrie e interazioni fondamentali

## Info about the course

* Language : Italian

* The course on Symmetries and Fundamental Interactions was held by professor Antonio Davide Polosa at **Sapienza University**, the notes have been taken during the first semester of academic year 2020/2021.

## Characteristics of the notes

- I took the notes using _Notabilty_ on **Ipad pro**.
- The notes are hand taken, I hope I'll will be able to convert them in LaTeX one day.
- I divided the notes into the two parts of the course, you will be able to easily see the different topics in the PDF.
- These notes are easily editable, if you spot some errors please let me know e-mailing me or via social networks, my contacts are in home/about.
