# Quantum Electrodynamics

## Info about the course

* Language : English

* The course on quantum Electrodynamics was held by professor Mauro Lucio Papinutto[^1] at **Sapienza University**, the notes have been taken during the second semester of academic year 2020/2021.

## Characteristics of the notes

- I took the notes using _Notabilty_ on **Ipad pro**.
- The notes are hand taken, I hope I'll will be able to convert them in LaTeX one day.
- The notes are given in a single (long) file, but there is an index in this page and at the beginning of the notes too.
- These notes are easily editable, if you spot some errors please let me know e-mailing me or via social networks, my contacts are in home/about.
