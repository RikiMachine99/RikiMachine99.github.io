# Relativistic quantum mechanics

## Info about the course

* Language : italian

* The course "Struttura della Materia" (Matter Structure) was held by professor Giovanni Battista Bachelet [] at **Sapienza University**, the notes have been taken during the second semester of academic year 2019/2020.

## Characteristics of the notes

- I took raw notes using **Ipad pro**, then they were fixed on paper 
- The notes divided in 3 macro arguments: 
    * Atomic Physiscs
    * Molecular Physics
    * Solid state Physics
- In the future i will list notes based on smaller arguments.
