# My bachelor thesis project 

## Title: Autovalori e stati legati dellâ€™Hamiltoniana in presenza del potenziale di Yukawa

The thesis project was written in Italian, in it I looked for **eigenvalues** and **eigenstates** of the Hamiltonian of a system with Yukawa potential, enhancing the removal of Coulomb degeneracy of states with same quantum number $n$.

The thesis is available at the following link: [Riccardo Marinelli Thesis](/Tesi.pdf)
