      <description>My bachelor thesis project Title: Autovalori e stati legati dellâ€™Hamiltoniana in presenza del potenziale di Yukawa The thesis project was written in Italian, in it I looked for eigenvalues and eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of a system with Yukawa potential, enhancing the removal of Coulomb degeneracy of states with same quantum number $n$.
The thesis is available at the following link: Riccardo Marinelli Thesis</description>

      <description>Relativistic quantum mechanics Info about the course the course on Relativistic Quantum Mechanic was held by professor Roberto Bonciani1 at Sapienza University, the notes have been taken during the firt semester of academic year 2020/2021.
Characteristics of the notes  I took the notes using Notabilty on Ipad pro. The notes are hand taken, I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll will be able to convert then in LaTeX one day. For now I will put the notes divided by week, in the future i will list notes based on arguments.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s me: Riccardo Marinelli Past education I went to primary and secondary school in Monteiasi (Ta) until I chose my high school: Liceo Scientifico Battaglini, in Taranto (TA); there I developed my interests in Maths, Physics and science in general.
In Monteiasi I also recieved catholic education, I&amp;rsquo;m still a proud catholic.
In 2017 I moved from Monteiasi to Rome where I became a Physics student at &amp;ldquo;La Sapienza&amp;rdquo; University and where I obtained the bachelor degree cum laude.</description>
