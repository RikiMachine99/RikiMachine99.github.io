      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s me: Riccardo Marinelli Past education I went to primary and secondary school in Monteiasi (Ta) until I chose my high school: Liceo Scientifico Battaglini, in Taranto (TA); there I developed my interests in Maths, Physics and science in general.
In Monteiasi I also recieved catholic education, I&amp;rsquo;m still a proud catholic.
In 2017 I moved from Monteiasi to Rome where I became a Physics student at &amp;ldquo;La Sapienza&amp;rdquo; University and where I obtained the bachelor degree cum laude.</description>
