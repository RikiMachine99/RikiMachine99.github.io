      <description>Relativistic quantum mechanics Info about the course the course on Relativistic Quantum Mechanic was held by professor Roberto Bonciani1 at Sapienza University, the notes have been taken during the firt semester of academic year 2020/2021.
Characteristics of the notes  I took the notes using Notabilty on Ipad pro. The notes are hand taken, I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll will be able to convert then in LaTeX one day. For now I will put the notes divided by week, in the future i will list notes based on arguments.</description>
